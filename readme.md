 # This repository contains the relevant code for the project on flood risk and real option analysis
 # There are several parts. 

 # Part 1: Data Collection
 The folder data contains the relevant data for the three case studies in New York City, South East Queensland, and Copenhagen. For sea level data we use hourly data available from the archives of the University of Hawaii Sea Level Centre (http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu).
